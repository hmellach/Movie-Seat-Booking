# Movie-Seat-Booking
Developed a user interface (UI) using HTML and CSS to establish the visual structure and styling. 
Incorporated JavaScript (JS) to provide interactive functionality. 
The website facilitates seat reservations for various movies, allowing users to select seats and proceed with booking. 
It supports the dynamic addition of movies, with JS automatically computing the total cost based on the chosen seats. 
JS is also responsible for real-time updates, recalculating the cost when seats are deselected. CSS handles visual indications, altering seat colors upon selection. 
Additionally, integrated local storage within JS to preserve data across page refreshes and prevent data loss.
